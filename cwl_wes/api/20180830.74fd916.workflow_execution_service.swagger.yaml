        Run a workflow.  This endpoint creates a new workflow run and
        returns the workflow ID to monitor its progress.
        The request may upload files that are required to execute the
        workflow identified as `workflow_attachment`.  The parts
        supplied in `workflow_attachment` may include the primary
        workflow, tools imported by the workflow, other files
        referenced by the workflow, or files which are part of the
        input.  The implementation should stage these files to a
        temporary directory and execute the workflow from there.
        These parts must have a Content-Disposition header with a
        "filename" provided for each part.  Filenames may include
        subdirectories, but must not include references to parent
        directories with '..', implementations should guard against
        maliciously constructed filenames.
        The `workflow_url` is either an absolute URL to a workflow
        file that is accessible by the WES endpoint, or a relative URL
        corresponding to one of the files attached using
        `workflow_attachment`.
        The `workflow_params` JSON object specifies input parameters,
        such as input files.  The exact format of the JSON object
        depends on the conventions of the workflow language being
        used.  Input files should either be absolute URLs, or relative
        URLs corresponding to files uploaded using
        `workflow_attachment`.  The WES endpoint must understand and
        be able to access URLs supplied in the input.  This is
        implementation specific.
        See documentation for WorkflowRequest for detail about other
        fields.

      This provides a safe default for messages where this field is missing,
      for example, so that a missing field does not accidentally imply that
      the state is QUEUED.
       - QUEUED: The task is queued.
       - INITIALIZING: The task has been assigned to a worker and is currently preparing to run.
      For example, the worker may be turning on, downloading input files, etc.
       - RUNNING: The task is running. Input files are downloaded and the first Executor
      has been started.
       - PAUSED: The task is paused.
      An implementation may have the ability to pause a task, but this is not required.
       - COMPLETE: The task has completed running. Executors have exited without error
      and output files have been successfully uploaded.
       - EXECUTOR_ERROR: The task encountered an error in one of the Executor processes. Generally,
      this means that an Executor exited with a non-zero exit code.
       - SYSTEM_ERROR: The task was stopped due to a system error, but not from an Executor,
      for example an upload failed due to network issues, the worker's ran out
      of disk space, etc.
       - CANCELED: The task was canceled by the user.
